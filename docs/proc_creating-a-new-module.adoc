= Creating a new module

// Write a short introductory paragraph that provides an overview of the module. The introduction should include what the module will help the user do and why it will be beneficial to the user. Include key words that relate to the module to maximize search engine optimization.

// .Procedure

. In the directory where modules are located, use `newdoc` to create a new file:
+
----
modules-dir]$ newdoc --procedure "Setting up thing"
----
+
The tool also accepts the `--concept` and `--reference` options. You can use these short forms instead: `-p`, `-c`, and `-r`.

. Rewrite the placeholders in the generated file with your docs.
