////
Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
* file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
* ID: [id="doing-procedure-a_{context}"]
* Title: = Doing procedure A

The ID is an anchor that links to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken. The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in an assembly file.

Indicate the module type in one of the following
ways:
Add the prefix proc- or proc_ to the file name.
Add the following attribute before the module ID:

////
Start the title of a procedure module with a gerund, such as Creating, Installing, or Deploying.
////

{% if examples -%}
Write a short introductory paragraph that provides an overview of the module. The introduction should include what the module will help the user do and why it will be beneficial to the user. Include key words that relate to the module to maximize search engine optimization.
{%- endif %}

.Prerequisites

{% if examples -%}
* A bulleted list of conditions that must be satisfied before the user starts the steps in this module.
* Prerequisites can be full sentences or sentence fragments; however, prerequisite list items must be parallel.
{%- endif %}

////
If you have only one prerequisite, list it as a single bullet point.
Do not write prerequisites in the imperative.
You can include links to more information about the prerequisites.
Delete the .Prerequisites section title and bullets if the module has no prerequisites.
////

.Procedure

{% if examples -%}
. Make each step an instruction.

. Include one command or action for each step with the exception of simple follow-step, for example:
.. Do this thing and then select *Next*.
.. Do this other thing and then select *Next*.

. Use an unnumbered bullet (*) if the procedure includes only one step.
{%- endif %}

.Verification

{% if examples -%}
Delete this section if it does not apply to your module. Provide the user with verification methods for the procedure, such as expected output or commands that confirm success or failure.

* Provide an example of expected command output or a pop-up window that the user receives when the procedure is successful.
* List actions for the user to complete, such as entering a command, to determine the success or failure of the procedure.
* Make each step an instruction.
* Include one command or action per step.
* Use an unnumbered bullet (*) if the verification includes only one step.
{%- endif %}

.Next steps

{% if examples -%}
* This section is optional.
* Provide a bulleted list of links that contain instructions that might be useful to the user after they complete this procedure.
* Use an unnumbered bullet (*) if the list includes only one step.

NOTE: Do not use *Next steps* to provide a second list of instructions.

[role="_additional-resources"]
.Additional resources

{% if examples -%}
* This section is optional.
* Provide a bulleted list of links to other closely-related material. These links can include `link:` and `xref:` macros.
* Use an unnumbered bullet (*) if the list includes only one step.
