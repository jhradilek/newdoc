# templates

This directory contains the templates that `newdoc` uses at runtime to generate new files.

The templates are AsciiDoc files with additional directives for `newdoc` to replace certain parts of the content with generated text. Currently, the directives do not comply to any templating standard, and instead, they are simple replaceable strings.
